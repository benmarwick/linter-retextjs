# atom-linter-retext

[**Atom**][atom] [**linter**][linter] meets [**retext**][retext] to catch
suboptimal writing. This package will provide these checkers:

- [cliches](https://github.com/dunckr/retext-cliches)
- [equality](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-equality)
- [intensify](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-intensify)
- [profanities](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-profanities)

It does not include [readability](https://github.com/retextjs/retext-readability), and this is the main difference with [camjc/atom-linter-retext](https://github.com/camjc/atom-linter-retext)

## Installation
